    "## Project Objective\n",
    "Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to classify emails as spam (1) or legitimate/ham (0), then select the best-performing model for production deployment. This notebook builds upon the data cleaning and exploratory analysis from Notebook 01 and focuses on model testing, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation..\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "**Training Data:**\n",
    "- Size: 23,110 cleaned emails (after removing duplicates and missing values)\n",
    "- Features: 9 columns (Subject, Message, Date, Label, engineered features)\n",
    "- Split: 80/20 train-test split with stratification\n",
    "- Class Distribution: Balanced (~50% spam, ~50% ham)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Data:**\n",
    "- Size: 6,743 held-out emails (20% of original dataset)\n",
    "- Purpose: Final performance evaluation\n",
    "- Never used during model development or hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Features Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Features:\n",
    "- **Combined Text:** Subject + Message concatenated\n",
    "- **Text Preprocessing:** Lowercase conversion and whitespace stripping\n",
    "- **Stopwords/Punctuation:** Retained because they are important spam indicators like \"!!!\", \"FREE\"\n",
    "- **Vectorization:** TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engineered Features:\n",
    "- **day_of_week:** Day email was sent (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)\n",
    "- **repeat_freq:** Number of times email subject+message appears in dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Feature Space:\n",
    "- 67,000 TF-IDF features  \n",
    "- 2 scaled features: day_of_week, repeat_freq\n",
    "- Total: 67,002 features per email\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Models Evaluated\n",
    "Four classification algorithms were compared using 5-fold stratified cross-validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multinomial Naive Bayes** - Fast probabilistic baseline\n",
    "2. **SVC (Linear Kernel)** - Support Vector Classifier\n",
    "3. **Logistic Regression** - Linear probabilistic classifier  \n",
    "4. **LinearSVC** - Optimized linear SVM (best performer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection Criteria: Models chosen for proven effectiveness on high-dimensional sparse text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "### 1. Text Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "    - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) transformation\n",
    "    - Simple processing of text where it is stripped and converted to lower case\n",
    "    - Preserved stopwords and punctuation which are important spam indicators\n",
    "    - Converted email text into 143,211 numerical features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Hyperparameter Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Use fast MultinomialNB to find optimal TF-IDF features, then apply to other models\n",
    "\n",
    "**GridSearch Process:**\n",
    "- First pass: [10k, 20k, 30k, 50k, 60k, 70k, 80k] features → Best: 60k\n",
    "- Second pass: [60k, 65k, 70k, 75k] features → Best: 70k\n",
    "- Third pass: [66k, 67k, 68k, 69k, 70k, 71k, 72k] features → Best: 67k\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** 67,000 features maximizes F1 score (0.9883)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why tune with MultinomialNB?**\n",
    "- 4-5× faster than LinearSVC\n",
    "- Feature sensitivity helps identify optimal count\n",
    "- Results transfer well to other models\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Model Evaluation\n",
    "**Model evluation metrics used :**\n",
    "- F1 Score: Primary metric that is the harmonic mean of precision and recall\n",
    "- Precision (spam): Minimize false positives (ham marked as spam)\n",
    "- Recall (spam): Catch all spam emails\n",
    "- Recall (ham): Minimize false negatives -> don't block legitimate emails\n",
    "- AUC-ROC: Overall classification ability\n",
    "- Accuracy: Overall correctness\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Pipeline Architecture\n",
    "All models use scikit-learn pipelines for consistency and deployment-readiness:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Pipeline:  \n",
    "├─ ColumnTransformer (preprocessing)  \n",
    "│    ├─ TfidfVectorizer(max_features=67000) → 'combined_with_stopwords'  \n",
    "│    └─ StandardScaler → ['day_of_week', 'repeat_freq']  \n",
    "└─ Model (LinearSVC / LogisticRegression / SVC)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "**Saved Pipeline:** `spam_trained_model.joblib`\n",
    "- Complete preprocessing + trained LinearSVC model\n",
    "- Ready for production deployment\n",
    "- Consistent preprocessing guaranteed\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Results:\n",
    "`LinearSVC was the best performer`  \n",
    "**Test set performance:**  \n",
    "- `Accuracy: 99.42%`\n",
    "- F1: 0.9942\n",
    "- Precision: 0.9912\n",
    "- Recall: 0.9972\n",
    "- Accuracy: 0.9942\n",
    "---\n",
    "This meanes the model had:  \n",
    "- Correctly classified: 6,705 out of 6,743 emails\n",
    "- False Positives (Ham→Spam): 29 (0.43%)\n",
    "- False Negatives (Spam→Ham): 9 (0.13%)\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Why LinearSVC Performed Best:\n",
    "- Optimized for high-dimensional sparse data (67,000 TF-IDF features)\n",
    "- Better at catching ham emails meaning highest recall_ham score\n",
    "- Best balance across all metrics wih no weak spots\n",
    "- Computationally efficient because it is faster than kernel SVC\n",
    "- Generalizes well because it had consistent train/test performance\n",
    "- Highest overall accuracy at 99.12% and highers F1 score at 99.1%\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "- 67,000 vs 10,000 features: +0.6% F1 score improvement\n",
    "- day_of_week feature: Marginal improvement in scores\n",
    "- Repeat frequency: Helps identify recurring spam campaigns\n",
    "- Keeping stopwords/punctuation: important for spam detection. Some examples: (\"!!!\", \"FREE\", \"CLICK HERE\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Insights\n",
    "**Spam Indicators Learned by Model:**\n",
    "- Words: \"money\", \"investment\", \"account\"\n",
    "- Patterns: Excessive punctuation (!!!), ALL CAPS, multiple links\n",
    "- Repetition: Same message sent multiple times\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ham Indicators:**\n",
    "- Words: \"meeting\", \"attached\", \"please\", \"regards\", \"schedule\"\n",
    "- Patterns: Professional tone, proper grammar, context-specific terms\n",
    "- Sender patterns: Work-related communication style\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Potential model limitaions\n",
    "- False Positives (ham -> spam):\n",
    "    - Marketing emails from legitimate companies\n",
    "    - Newsletters with promotional language\n",
    "- False Negatives (spam -> ham):\n",
    "    - Sophisticated phishing attempts mimicking business emails\n",
    "    - Spam with minimal promotional language\n",
    "\n",
    "## To get predict probability of a prediction\n",
    "I need to be able to calculate the predict probability of the predictions, but LinearSVC does not have predict proba, so a workaround is to calculate the decision score.Decision scores represent the distance to the decision boundary:\n",
    "- Positive scores → Classified as SPAM -> the more positive the further it is from decision boundary on the positive side and is more confident\n",
    "- Negative scores → Classified as HAM -> the more negative the further it is from decision boundary on the negative side and is more confident\n",
    "- Score near 0 → On the decision boundary -> uncertain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next steps:\n",
    "- REST API deployment (Flask/FastAPI)\n",
    "- Web interface for real time classification\n",
    "- Production monitoring dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "- All models performed excellently at more than 98% accuracy on this balanced dataset \n",
    "- Using 67,000 features vs 10,000 improved performance\n",
    "- Adding temporal features (day_of_week, repeat_freq) helped slightly\n",
    "- Text preprocessing matters: Keeping stopwords/punctuation improved spam detection\n",
    "- More features = better performance: 60k features outperformed 10k\n",
    "- Linear models work well: High-dimensional sparse data is often linearly separable\n",
    "- Cross-validation is essential: Prevented overfitting and validated generalization\n",
    "- Simple wins: LinearSVC beat complex models with better speed and accuracy\n",

    "## GridSearch\n",
    "The purpose of a gridsearch is to find the optimal number of TF-IDF features that maximizes model performance without overfitting.\n",
    "- I need to find the best max_features in TfidfVectorizer that has enough features for prediction without loss of information and without overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline Structure:**  \n",
    "```\n",
    "    |─ ColumnTransformer (preprocessing)           --> allows different preprocessing for different column types:  \n",
    "    │   ├─ TfidfVectorizer → emails['combined_with_stopwords']  \n",
    "    │   └─ MinMaxScaler → emails[['day_of_week', 'repeat_freq']]  \n",
    "    └─ Model (MultinomialNB / SVC / LinearSVC ...)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "### GridSearch strategy:\n",
    "- The parameter that needs to be tuned: max_features in TfidfVectorizer\n",
    "- Search Space: [10,000, 30,000, 50,000, 60,000, 70,000] as a starting point then iterate with closer values to the max value returned \n",
    "- Run GridSearch with more precise numbers\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Evaluation:\n",
    "- 5 fold cross-validation on training data\n",
    "- Optimize for F1 score which balances precision and recall\n",
    "- Compare all metrics (Precision, Recall for spam, Recall for ham, AUC, Accuracy)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "- Use MultinomialNB + GridSearchCV to find optimal max_features\n",
    "- Apply the optimal setting to the other models\n",
    "- This saves ~1-2 hours of computation time \n",
    "\n",
    "**Search Space:** Start with (10,000, 30,000, 50,000, 60,000) TF-IDF features"

    "### Hyperparameter tuning of optimal max_features, why use MultinomialNB \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Speed:\n",
    "    - MultinomialNB trains 4 to 5 times faster than LinearSVC and more than 10 times faster than SVC\n",
    "    - Allows rapid exploration of feature space\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Sensitivity: NB performance is highly responsive to feature count\n",

    "   - Optimal features for NB generalize to other models\n",
